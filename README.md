My Final Assignment Portfolio

## Process
The development process began with translating the high-fidelity wireframe from the UX Design I assignment into a responsive Bootstrap-based website. 
I structured the HTML files, implemented Bootstrap components, and customized styles using CSS variables. The site was then optimized for various screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

## Challenges
One challenge was ensuring the website was responsive and met accessibility standards. This was addressed by using Bootstrap's responsive grid and implementing ARIA roles.

## Learning
This project improved my understanding of Bootstrap and responsive design principles. I also learned how to implement accessibility features effectively.

## Assets and Resources
